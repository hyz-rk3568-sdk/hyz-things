# hyz-things Web frontend refactor progress

This file records implementation evidence while `hyz-things-web-frontend-refactor-plan.md` is being executed. The final Host matrix must still be copied back into the plan before the refactor is marked complete.

## 2026-09-10 — structural checkpoint

- Remaining page ownership has been extracted into `pages/overview.rs` and `pages/system.rs`.
- `pages/mod.rs` and `hooks/mod.rs` now provide the normal module roots instead of root-level `#[path]` aliases.
- `app.rs` owns portal composition/navigation/reducer orchestration; the System arm delegates page rendering to `pages/system.rs`.
- The structural driver passed migration, rustfmt, WASM `cargo check`, `git diff --check`, and generated-commit gates. The checkpoint script also guards against the E2E navigation migration becoming non-idempotent and against countdown unit-test registration being dropped.
- The PiP countdown Playwright helper now converts day/hour/minute/second fields into real seconds instead of adding display fields directly.
- The administrator STA/AP/subscription journey now has one canonical Network → Proxy → Network transition; the migration source no longer inserts duplicate STA assertions on repeated runs.
- Deterministic countdown coverage is registered under `hooks/countdown_tests.rs`. Full CI run `34478106507` executed the browser-side unit target and reported 9/9 passing tests. The five plan-specific cases all passed: future target, past target, target boundary, custom countdown/storage round-trip, and invalid storage data.
- On the same human-authored head `a894de845bf6a1c23a4fc1088cfac58e6a7152f4`, run `34478106507` passed `git diff --check`, `make check-static`, contract format/tests/Clippy, deterministic frontend bundle, things format, web unit logic, native tests (41 unit + 3 HTTP integration), strict Clippy, and artifact verification.
- The Playwright job in run `34478106507` passed all 32 tests in Chromium with no business assertions deleted.

**Structural stage result: passed.** Plan section 14.1 is satisfied for the current checkpoint. Work may proceed to section 7 shared UI components, but navigation expansion, Overview redesign, semantic theme work, and visual cleanup remain deferred until the shared-component stage is itself green.

## Next stage — shared UI components

Start with low-risk semantic presentation components that preserve existing accessible roles/names and DOM behavior. Initial candidates are `LoadingState`, `EmptyState`, and `MetricCard`. `StatusBadge`, section/header abstractions, `CountdownCard`, and `AppShell` should follow only when their repeated product semantics are clear; avoid generic one-div wrappers.
